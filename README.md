# Mission to Mars

The purpose of this project was to create a responsive web page with flask, selenium, and bootstrap. This webpage tracks
the featured news on NASA mars news, featured images, and facts. The bootstrap components that were added to the HTML file
were button modification, responsiveness, hemisphere image resizing, and table resizing.
